# Discrete Mathematics syllabus

* **Course Code:** DISMATH 
* **Course Title:** Discrete Mathematics and its Applications
* **Instructor:** Melvin Cabatuan, [melvin.cabatuan@dlsu.edu.ph](mailto:melvin.cabatuan@dlsu.edu.ph)

## Course Description

This course covers elementary discrete mathematics for engineering. It focuses on definitions and proofs as well as practicable methods to provide students with a solid understanding of the material as it relates to their immediate field of study. Topics include propositional and predicate logic, set theory, number theory, methods of proof, combinatorial analysis, functions, relations, algorithms, graph theory, trees, and modeling computation.

## Prerequisite

* ENGALG1(H): College Algebra

## Course Overview

We will start with a review of fundamental concepts on logic, sets, numbers, proofs, functions, relations, and then dive into algorithms (with complexity analysis) and proceed with the course on the introduction to basic data structures such as graphs and trees. The course will be concluded with an introduction to abstract models of computation, i.e. finite-state machines. The focus will be on building a comprehensive foundation for computational problem-solving in engineering:

* Logic, Sets, and Functions
* Relations
* Methods of Proof
* Sequences, Series, Induction, and Recursion
* Counting Fundamentals and  Advanced Counting Techniques
* Algorithms and Complexity Analysis
* Elementary Graph Theory
    * Euler and Hamiltonian Paths
    * Planar Graphs
* Trees 
    * Tree Traversal
    * Spanning Trees
* Modeling Computation


## Homework/Projects

All assignments are listed within the [Course Outline](#course-outline).

### Workflow

If you're using GitHub Desktop, [these instructions](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/) will help explain the Git/GitHub concepts. Here are the overall steps:

1. Fork the repository for the exercise/project (found under [github.com/DeLaSalleUniversity-Manila-DISMATH-t216](https://github.com/DeLaSalleUniversity-Manila-DISMATH-t216)).
1. Clone the repository to your computer.
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser and open the Developer Tools.
1. Modify the files to complete your solution.
1. Refresh the `index.html` page to see the results, and repeat.
1. Make sure all of your code is committed.
1. Push/sync up to GitHub.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) on the original repository. All assignments are due at the start of the following class, unless otherwise specified.
1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements until the close date (listed in Classes) – just add a comment in the pull request to let me know it's been updated.

When the pull request is created, you should see a message saying that "the Travis CI build is in progress" – this means that your solution is being automatically checked for syntax errors.  If this "build" ends up failing (which will show a red "X"), click through the "details" link and scroll to the bottom to see what the errors were.  Per the [requirements](#requirements) below, please fix the issues and push up the changes.

Note that your solution will also be live at `http://USERNAME.github.io/EXERCISE`.  For exercises with multiple levels/versions, leave a new comment in the pull request saying "Level X finished!" before pushing commits for the next level. "BONUS" levels are for extra credit.
